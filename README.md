Manual Implementation of Neural Network: The entire neural network is built using Pythonâ€™s basic libraries, with no use of high-level frameworks.
Backpropagation and Gradient Descent: Implemented from scratch to train the neural network.
Customizable Architecture: Flexible to adjust the number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, and other parameters.
Example Use Case: Demonstration of training the neural network on a dataset (e.g., MNIST, XOR problem, or any other simple dataset).
